== What is it?

This quickstart shows how to use Windup in a Maven project to create reports for migration to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.

The quickstart also contains one custom Windup rule in a XML file and shows where to place it to let Windup find it.

The example project contains the Seam `@Asynchronous` annotation which is not compatible with remote EJBs in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and must be replaced with the Java EE 6 `@Asynchronous` annotation.
