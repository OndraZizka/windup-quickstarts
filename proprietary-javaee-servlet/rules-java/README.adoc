Summary: Windup Java-based rule add-on that reports on Proprietary servlet annotations +
Source: https://github.com/windup/windup-quickstarts/ +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

In this example, the fictional "Proprietary" corporation provides its own proprietary servlet and filter annotations for dependency injection. 
If the application uses them, they must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 annotations. 
This example demonstrates how to create a Java-based RuleProvider that searches for these proprietary annotations and reports on them.

This Java-based Windup rule add-on searches for the following annotations:

* _@ProprietaryServlet_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebServlet_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryFilter_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebFilter_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryInitParam_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebInitParam_ annotation.

[[review-the-quickstart-code]]
== Review the Quickstart Code

The _ProprietaryServletAnnotationRuleProvider_ class extends _RuleProvider_ and overrides the following methods:

* `getExecuteAfter()`: Nothing executes after this, so this method returns an empty list.
* `enhanceMetadata(Context context)`: This method specifies additional metadata about the Rule instances originating from this RuleProvider.
* `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)`: This method does the following.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryServlet` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryServlet" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryServlet annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebServlet annotation.
** Assigns 1 story point of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryInitParam` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryInitParam" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryInitParam annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebInitParam annotation.
** Assigns 2 story points of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryFilter` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryFilter" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryFilter annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebFilter annotation.
** Assigns 3 story points of effort to this task.

[[add-the-quickstart-to-windup]]
== Add the Quickstart to Windup

There are 2 ways to add the quickstart to Windup.

* link:#build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-one-simple-step[Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in One Simple Step]: 
You can build and install the quickstart into the Maven repository and install it into Windup using one command.This is the fastest way to install a rule add-on into Windup.
* link:#build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-two-separate-steps[Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in Two Separate Steps]: 
You can use a Maven command to build and install the quickstart into the Maven repository and a separate Windup command to install it into Windup.

[[build-and-install-the-quickstart-as-a-windup-add-on-in-one-simple-step]]
== Build and Install the Quickstart as a Windup Add-on in One Simple Step

This is the easiest and fastest way to build the quickstart, install it
into the local Maven repository, and install it into Windup as a rule add-on.

. If you have not started Windup, follow the instructions above to link:#start-windup[Start Windup].
. Build the quickstart and install the add-on in Windup using the `addon-build-and-install` command in the Windup console.
* The command uses the following syntax, where `QUICKSTART_HOME` refers the root directory of this `proprietary-javaee-servlet` quickstart:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot QUICKSTART_HOME/rules-java  
----
+
For example:
+
----
addon-build-and-install --projectRoot /home/username/windup-quickstarts/proprietary-javaee-servlet/rules-java  
----
+
* You should see the following result.
+
----
***SUCCESS*** Addon org.jboss.windup.quickstarts:windup-proprietary-javaee-servlet:::2.0.0.Final was installed successfully.
