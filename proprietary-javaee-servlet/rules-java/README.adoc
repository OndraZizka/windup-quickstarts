Summary: Windup Java-based rule add-on that reports on Proprietary servlet annotations +

[[what-is-it]]
== What is it?

In this example, the fictional "Proprietary" corporation provides its own proprietary servlet and filter annotations for dependency injection. 
If the application uses them, they must be replaced with the standard Java EE 6 annotations. 
This example demonstrates how to create a Java-based RuleProvider that searches for these proprietary annotations and reports on them.

This Java-based Windup rule add-on searches for the following annotations:

* _@ProprietaryServlet_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebServlet_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryFilter_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebFilter_ annotation.
* _@ProprietaryInitParam_: This is the equivalent of the Java EE 6 _@WebInitParam_ annotation.

These instructions use the following replaceable variables. 

* `WINDUP_HOME`: Replace this variable with the fully qualified path to your Windup installation.
* `QUICKSTART_HOME`: Replace this variable with the fully qualified path to the root directory of this quickstart.

== Review the Quickstart Code

The _ProprietaryServletAnnotationRuleProvider_ class extends _RuleProvider_ and overrides the following methods:

* `getExecuteAfter()`: Nothing executes after this, so this method returns an empty list.
* `enhanceMetadata(Context context)`: This method specifies additional metadata about the Rule instances originating from this RuleProvider.
* `getConfiguration(GraphContext context)`: This method does the following.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryServlet` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryServlet" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryServlet annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebServlet annotation.
** Assigns 1 story point of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryInitParam` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryInitParam" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryInitParam annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebInitParam annotation.
** Assigns 2 story points of effort to this task.
* Adds a rule that looks for `com.example.proprietary.servlet.annotation.ProprietaryFilter` annotations. If found:
** Classifies the annotation as "Proprietary @ProprietaryFilter" and provides a link to the Java EE `javax.servlet.annotation` package Javadoc.
** Provides a warning text telling the user to replace the proprietary @ProprietaryFilter annotation with the Java EE 6 standard @WebFilter annotation.
** Assigns 3 story points of effort to this task.

[[system-requirements]]
== System requirements

The rule this project produces is designed to be run on Windup 2.x or later.

This project requires Java 7.0 (Java SDK 1.7) or later and Maven 3.0 or later.

[[install-windup]]
== Install Windup

If you have not installed Windup, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/windup/windup/wiki/Install[Download and Install Windup].

[[configure-maven]]
== Configure Maven

If you have not yet installed and configured Maven, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/windup/windup/wiki/Install-and-Configure-Maven[Install and Configure Maven].

An example `settings.xml` file is provided in the root directory of the quickstarts.

[[build-the-quickstart-rule]]
== Build the Quickstart Rule Add-on

Before Windup can use this rule, it must be compiled and added to the local Maven repository.

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the `QUICKSTART_HOME/rules-java/` directory.
. Type the following command to compile the quickstart and install it into the local Maven repository:
+
----
mvn clean install
----
. You should see the message `BUILD SUCCESS`


[[add-the-quickstart-to-windup]]
== Add the Quickstart to Windup

The command to install the rule in Windup uses the Maven GAV (groupId, artifactId, and optional version) to locate the rule in the Maven repository. The command uses the following syntax.

----
WINDUP_HOME/bin/windup --install GROUP_ID:ARTIFACT_ID[,VERSION]
----

To find these values, open the  QUICKSTART_HOME/rules-java/pom.xml file. These values are located near the beginning of the file.

[source,xml]
----
<groupId>org.jboss.windup.quickstarts</groupId>
<artifactId>windup-proprietary-javaee-servlet-rules-java</artifactId>
<version>2.4.0.Final</version>
----

Follow these steps to add the rule to Windup.

. Open a command prompt and navigate to the `WINDUP_HOME` directory.
. Type the following command, which does not include the optional version.
+
----
bin/windup --install org.jboss.windup.quickstarts:windup-proprietary-javaee-servlet-rules-java
----

. At the following prompt, choose `Y`.
+
----
Confirm installation [Y/n]? Y
----

. You should see the following result.
+
----
Installation completed successfully.
----
. Type `exit` to exit the Windup console.
